## What can card/account holders buy using their GSA SmartPay® Fleet card/account?

It is important for card/account holders to understand the limits on fleet card/account use and to manage their purchases against those limits. 

The federal government or other authorized employees are permitted to use the fleet cards/account to make authorized purchases as determined by the agency/organization. Typically, fleet cards/accounts are used to purchase fuel, maintenance and repair for government owned/operated vehicles.

Examples of authorized purchases include:
- Regular unleaded self service fuel.
- Immediately consumable items for vehicles (quart of oil, washer fluid, etc.).
- Required preventative maintenance.
- Car washes (not to exceed $25 per month or as determined by your agency).
- Mechanical repairs.

Examples of unauthorized purchases include:
- Premium or full service fueling.
- Maps, air fresheners, food, etc.
- Buying services in excess of required repairs.
- Excessive car washes or details.
- Upgrading tires or accessories (which may vary depending on specific agency policy).

If a purchase appears questionable, card/account holders can reach out to their A/OPC or contracting office for guidance.

## What are some of the strategic payment solutions offered under GSA SmartPay 3? 
Strategic payment solutions provide agencies/organizations with increased payment flexibilities and strategies for making payments. 

Strategic payment solutions offered under the [GSA SmartPay 3 Master Contract](https://smartpay.gsa.gov/about/master-contract) include:


### ePayables
- Replaces the accounts payables process such that electronic transactions take place directly between the government and the supplier.
- Typically used with merchants who are traditionally paid by convenience check or electronic funds transfer (EFT) and do not accept charge card payments.
- Examples include straight-through processing, buyer-initiated payments, supplier-initiated payments, procure-to-pay and other card-not-present solutions. 


### Mobile Application
- Provides the ability to access the Electronic Access System (EAS), pay invoices, receive text/email alerts and view statement and payment information over a mobile device. 
- Upon request, your contractor bank provides mobile application capabilities at no additional cost. 

### Mobile Payments
- Your contractor bank provides the ability for card/account holders to make secure payments using a mobile device at the point-of-sale (POS).

### Net Billing
- The process of ensuring that merchant discounts or refunds offered are deducted at the POS and guaranteeing such discount arrangements. 
- The contractor bank ensures that discount information is identified on the invoice and passed to the agency/organization, when available. 
- For example: If Mark purchased a toner cartridge for $100 and the merchant offers a government discount of $4.00 to the agency/organization based on existing agreements, the contractor bank shall net bill only $96 for the transaction.

### Single-Use Account (SUAs)
- Leverages a single virtual account number for each payment. 
- The limit on each account is set to the specific payment amount. 
- Internal controls such as Merchant Category Code (MCC) blocks, spend limits, timeframes and account expiration dates can be used for increased control. 
- Agencies also have the ability to append accounting data for seamless reconciliation. 
- Examples of use include invoice and contract payments, which help to ensure that merchants are not able to charge more than approved amounts.
- Benefits include:
  * Accounts can be activated in real time.
  * Controls can be placed on account, allowing for increased oversight of spend
  * Disposable, one-time use account numbers reduce the risk of fraud.
  * Seamless reconciliation.
  * Reduces the necessity for using convenience checks.

### Tokenization
- Use of a secure, unique “token” in place of a 16-digit account number to provide extra security for transactions.

### Virtual Cards
- One-time use account numbers that may be used during a limited time, for a limited amount and possibly for a specific merchant.

### Ghost Cards
- For agencies who frequently do business with one merchant and have recurring payments.
- An account number can be assigned to the merchant and authorized agency personnel transactions occur without having to use multiple cards or accounts.
- Many agencies use this product for purchases such as airline tickets. 
- Benefits may include:
  * Reduced number of open accounts (payment processing and oversight easier).
  * Allows for multiple users.
  * Allows for a high level of control.
  * Reduces the risk of lost or stolen cards.

## What is Section 889 and how does it apply to purchases?
Section 889 of the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2019 ([P.L. 115-232 [PDF, 789 pages]](https://www.congress.gov/115/plaws/publ232/PLAW-115publ232.pdf)) and the [Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Case 2018-017](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/08/13/2019-17201/federal-acquisition-regulation-prohibition-on-contracting-for-certain-telecommunications-and-video) prohibit the purchase of covered telecommunications equipment and services from merchants who sell products containing spyware. These devices could pose a threat to U.S. security by spying on or disrupting communications within the U.S. Therefore, purchase card/account holders should follow their agency’s policy regarding Section 889 compliance.
