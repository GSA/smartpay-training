## Welcome to the GSA SmartPay® Fleet Training for Agency/Organization Program Coordinators (A/OPCs)

As an A/OPC, you play a critical role in your agency’s/organization’s fleet program. You work with the card/account holders, the bank and other key stakeholders to ensure that all fleet card/accounts are effectively managed.

This training course is intended to teach you the basics about your roles and responsibilities as an A/OPC. The course can be used as refresher training as required by your agency. In addition, we encourage you to also learn about your agency’s specific fleet program policies since they will be the foundation of your day-to-day duties.

The contractor bank also provides valuable tools to you, such as the Electronic Access System (EAS) and A/OPC Guides.

**Note:** The GSA SmartPay training website is an independent training system and does not connect/communicate with any other agency training systems.
