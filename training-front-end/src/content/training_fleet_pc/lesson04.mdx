order: 4
---

## What are some A/OPC responsibilities?

### General
- Oversees the purchase program for your agency/organization to best support your mission.
- Develops agency program procedures and policies as necessary.
- Serves as the liaison between the card/account holder, the contractor bank, your management and the GSA Center for Charge Card Management (CCCM).
- Please note that the lead A/OPC may be supported by regional or field A/OPCs with distinct responsibilities.

### Managing Card/Account Holders
- Maintains a current list of account names, account numbers, contact information of all current card/account holders and accounts.
- Maintains a current list of agency/organization points of contact for Designated Billing Offices (DBOs), Transaction Dispute Offices (TDOs) and Electronic Commerce/Electronic Data Interchange Offices (EOs), as applicable.
- Ensures card/account holders use the purchase program correctly.
- Monitors account activity and manages delinquencies.
- Ensures that appropriate steps are taken to mitigate suspension or cancellation actions.

### Training
- Receives training before appointment and participates in refresher training a minimum of every three years (or less depending on agency/organization policies) in accordance with [OMB Circular A-123, Appendix B](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Issuance-of-Revised-Appendix-B-to-OMB-Circular-A-123.pdf).
- Participates in annual training forums and disseminates information and lessons learned to other A/OPCs, account managers and card/account holders.
- Ensures that card/account holders are trained prior to receiving their purchase card/account and that they take refresher training at a minimum every three years (or more often if required by your agency).

### Master Contract/Task Order Compliance
- Oversees the business line for your agency/organization and establishes agency/organization guidelines.
- Directs the contractor bank to establish accounts.
- Serves as liaison between the card/account holder and the contractor bank.
- Provides on-going program guidance.
- Audits accounts as required.
- Keeps necessary account information current for the agency/organization.
- Please note that the terms and conditions of the GSA SmartPay Master Contract can only be modified by the GSA SmartPay Contracting Officer. The A/OPC does not provide supervisory guidance to the contractor bank’s personnel.

### Card/Account Holder Hierarchies
- Establishes card/account holder hierarchies, which are often associated with billing and organizational structures. 
- Please note that hierarchy structures may vary from agency to agency due to each agency’s unique requirements. This includes the number of card/account holders managed by each A/OPC and the level of problem resolution. Once your agency determines the structure and requirements needed, the contractor bank will be able to assist with establishing your agency hierarchy levels.

### Communication
- Keeps the lines of communication open with all key program participants, including senior management/leadership.
- Stays in touch with purchase program participants by networking, asking questions and sharing policy changes, program information and/or other purchase card/account information.
- Please note that A/OPCs should try to establish relationships with the card/account holders within your span of control. The better you understand each purchase card/account holder's needs, the more effective you can be in managing the program and preventing or detecting misuse and fraud.

## How do I set up fleet cards/accounts?
As the A/OPC, you are responsible for setting up and maintaining centrally billed accounts (CBAs) and individually billed accounts (IBAs). Refer to your contractor bank’s A/OPC Guide, Cardholder Guide and EAS Manual for detailed instructions on how to set up accounts.

Please note that an employee’s personal credit history and a completed card/account holder application are not required to receive a GSA SmartPay fleet card/account. A/OPCs and fleet managers assign fleet cards/accounts to vehicles (not to individuals). 

Typically, A/OPCs complete the following step when setting up a new fleet card/account:

### Set Authorization Controls
At the time of account setup within the EAS, the A/OPC will set authorization controls. A/OPCs can change authorization controls at any time in case you determine that some are too restrictive (or not restrictive enough). Use authorization controls as a tool to prevent fraud and misuse. 

Here are some typical authorization controls:
- **Single purchase limit** - Restricting the dollar limit for an individual transaction.
- **Monthly purchase limit** - Restricting the cumulative dollar limit for purchases in one month. The monthly purchase limit may be set to any dollar amount equal to or greater than the single purchase limit.
- **Number of transactions limit** - Restricting the number of transactions per day and/or per month on each card/account.
- **Merchant Category Code (MCC) restrictions** - Purchases are restricted depending on the type of merchant (identified by the MCC). For fleet, instead of MCC, include the Product Number/Code.

## Are credit checks required for fleet card/account holders?
The contractor bank shall not provide any information to credit bureaus or perform any creditworthiness assessment for fleet cards/accounts, since they are CBAs.

## What is the process for renewing fleet cards/accounts?
For renewing CBA fleet cards/accounts:
- At least 180 calendar days prior to the expiration of each card/account, the contractor bank will submit a report to the A/OPC listing each expiring card/account. 
- The report will also contain all information necessary for the agency/organization to renew the card/account. 
- Fleet cards/accounts used within the past 90 calendar days will automatically renew unless otherwise directed from the A/OPC. 
- If the fleet card/account has not been used within the past 90 calendar days, the contractor bank shall close the card/account unless a renewal request is received by the A/OPC. 
- Renewed cards will be sent between 20-40 calendar days prior to card/account expiration date.

## How are accounts closed/terminated and what are the recommended exit procedures?
There are four steps to closing or terminating an account:
- Immediately notify the bank when a card/account holder leaves the agency/organization, is terminated from employment or no longer requires a fleet card/account.
- Follow the account close out procedures from your contractor bank.
- Instruct the card/account holder to destroy/dispose of the card by cutting it into pieces.
- Review the master file/account holder listing to ensure the account is closed.

## Are A/OPCs able to suspend or cancel an account? 
Yes, A/OPCs are able to suspend or cancel an account.

Suspension is the process by which an account is deactivated due to delinquency or multiple pre-suspension actions. An account is considered past due if payment for undisputed principal amounts has not been received within 45 calendar days from the billing date. 

An account can be canceled if an undisputed balance remains unpaid for the prescribed number of calendar days from the billing date. An account may also be canceled for numerous suspensions.


A reason must be documented for suspension or cancellation. Accounts may be canceled through your bank’s Electronic Access System (EAS) or through the bank’s customer service office. Under certain conditions, an A/OPC may request the contractor bank to delay or accelerate action for suspending or canceling an account.

In summary, please refer to the chart below:
| Number Calendar Days | Account Status/Action |
| -------------------- | --------------------- |
| 46 days from the billing date | Pre-Suspension |
| 61 days from the billing date | Suspension/Pre-Cancellation |
| 126 days from the billing date | Cancellation |
| 180 days from the billing date | Charge-Off/Write-Off|

\* *Please refer to your agency policy for specific delinquency stages as they may differ.*

For more details on suspension/cancellation procedures, see the GSA SmartPay Master Contract, Section C.3.3.11 Suspension Procedures and Section C.3.3.12 Cancellation Procedures.

The bank is required to automatically reinstate suspended accounts upon payment of the undisputed principal amount unless otherwise specified by you. You may also notify the bank of any mission-related, extenuating circumstances for which the account should not be suspended within the notification timeframes mentioned previously. Once an account has been canceled, the contractor bank is under no obligation to reinstate the account.

Please note that the liability for CBA transactions rests with the agency/organization, while liability for IBA transactions rests with the individual card/account holder.
## What is a write-off or credit loss?
A write-off is a canceled account with an unpaid balance determined to be uncollectible by the contractor bank.

## What happens if a fleet card/account is lost or stolen?
It is the card/account holder’s responsibility to immediately report the lost or stolen fleet card/account to:
- The contractor bank.
- You, the A/OPC.
- Their supervisor.

Once a card/account has been reported as lost or stolen, the contractor bank immediately blocks that account from further usage and a new account number will be issued to the card/account holder.

Reporting the card/account as stolen does not relieve the card/account holder or the government of payment for any transactions that were made by the card/account holder prior to reporting it stolen. If you do not recognize a transaction appearing on your statement, you are responsible for notifying the contractor bank within 90 calendar days from the transaction date to initiate a dispute, unless otherwise specified by the agency/organization. This notification of transaction dispute may occur via the EAS, by telephone or other electronic means like email.

Please note that card/account holders relinquish their right to recover a disputed amount after 90 calendar days from the date that the transaction was processed. 

## How does the bank support the A/OPC?
The contractor bank can provide you with tools to assist in successful management of your agency’s fleet program, including:
Establishing and maintaining accounts.
- Providing an Electronic Access System (EAS).
- Providing data mining tools and assistance to help detect potential fraud/misuse.
- Providing forms and reports.
- Resolving disputes.
