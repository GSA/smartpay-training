## How do I access reports related to the GSA SmartPay® Fleet program?

Agency/organization program coordinators (A/OPCs) can access electronic reports to monitor and track delinquency through the contractor bank's Electronic Access System (EAS). To access reports, contact your bank representative to obtain a user ID and password.

## What type of information is available through the EAS and when it is available?

Each bank has a slightly different suite of reports available, so review the contractor bank's A/OPC Guide or go online to learn about the specific reports offered. Please note that: 
- Most electronic reports are updated within two to three days after a transaction. However, some reports are only updated at the end of the billing cycle.
- A/OPCs have access to monitor card/account holder transactions at any time. By searching by card/account holder name, account number or social security number, you can track card/account holder transactions (such as transactions, payments and disputes), as well as view card/account holder monthly statements. You may also contact the bank’s customer service at any time to request information on a specific account.
- You may refer to GSA SmartPay Master Contract, Section C.7.1 Electronic Access System (EAS) for a full list of the EAS requirements.
