## Is there anyone else who will be involved with the GSA SmartPay program?
Because the GSA SmartPay program is a highly visible program and receives a lot of interest both within and outside your agency/organization, your agency/organization's management, the Inspector General (IG) staff and other investigators/auditors will likely be interested in the performance of the purchase program. Many agencies/organizations will have periodic audits of the purchase program and your A/OPC will likely be a key player in those audits. Additionally, you may find that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and Congress take an interest in the performance of your program.
