## What can I buy using my GSA SmartPay purchase card/account?

It is important to understand the limits on purchase card/account use and to manage your purchases against those limits. 

You are allowed to purchase any commercially available supply or service not prohibited by either federal government or agency-specific procurement regulations. To find out your agency specific procurement requirements regarding purchase amounts, receipt documentation and approvals contact your A/OPC or contracting officer. An approval may be required prior to purchase and may be needed in conjunction with a subsequent review of the purchase activity. If a purchase appears questionable, consult your A/OPC or contracting office.

## What is Section 889 and how does it apply to purchases?

Section 889 of the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2019 ([P.L. 115-232](https://www.congress.gov/115/plaws/publ232/PLAW-115publ232.pdf)) and the[ Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Case 2018-017](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/08/13/2019-17201/federal-acquisition-regulation-prohibition-on-contracting-for-certain-telecommunications-and-video) prohibit the purchase of covered telecommunications equipment and services from vendors who sell products containing spyware. These devices could pose a threat to U.S. security by spying on or disrupting communications within the U.S. Therefore, purchase card/account holders should follow their agency’s policy regarding Section 889 compliance.

## What are Government-to-Government transactions?

Government-to-government transactions are payments between different agencies (inter-governmental) or payments within the same agency (intra-governmental). In most instances, these transactions are classified under Merchant Category Code 9399, Miscellaneous Government Services. 

Effective October 1, 2022, the general limit on charge card payments within the same agency (intra-governmental) is set at $9,999.99. The general limit on charge card payments between different federal agencies (inter-governmental) remains $24,999.99. The government’s card acceptance policies can be found in [Treasury Financial Manual (TFM) Vol. I, Part 5, Chapter 7000](https://tfm.fiscal.treasury.gov/v1/p5/c700.html). It also addresses limitations on credit card transactions.

A few notes to keep in mind:

- Customers cannot divide an inter-governmental transaction into smaller pieces to evade this limit. For example, a buyer cannot make two purchases of $15,000 to avoid the $24,999.99 limit. 
- Customers cannot divide an intra-governmental transaction into smaller pieces to evade this limit. For example, a buyer cannot make two purchases of $6,000 to avoid the $9,999.99 limit. 
- Treasury retains the option to change limits. One goal is to reduce the fees the government pays when it accepts the purchase card/account for large transactions.
