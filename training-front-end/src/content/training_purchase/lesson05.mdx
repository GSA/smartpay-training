## What can I buy using my GSA SmartPay® Purchase card/account?

It is important to understand the limits on purchase card/account use and to manage your purchases against those limits. 

You are allowed to purchase any commercially available supply or service not prohibited by either federal government or agency-specific procurement regulations. To find out your agency specific procurement requirements regarding purchase amounts, receipt documentation and approvals contact your A/OPC or contracting officer. An approval may be required prior to purchase and may be needed in conjunction with a subsequent review of the purchase activity. If a purchase appears questionable, consult your A/OPC or contracting office.

## What is Section 889 and how does it apply to purchases?

Section 889 of the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2019 ([P.L. 115-232](https://www.congress.gov/115/plaws/publ232/PLAW-115publ232.pdf)) and the[ Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Case 2018-017](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/08/13/2019-17201/federal-acquisition-regulation-prohibition-on-contracting-for-certain-telecommunications-and-video) prohibit the purchase of covered telecommunications equipment and services from vendors who sell products containing spyware. These devices could pose a threat to U.S. security by spying on or disrupting communications within the U.S. Therefore, purchase card/account holders should follow their agency’s policy regarding Section 889 compliance.

## What are convenience checks?
Some agencies allow for the use of convenience checks. 

Convenience checks are:
- A contractor-provided instrument that is written, dated and signed against an account within established dollar limits. 
- Intended only for the use with merchants that do not accept the GSA SmartPay Purchase card/account. 
- A payment method of last resort, only when no reasonable alternative merchant is available who accepts the GSA SmartPay Purchase card/account.

If your agency/organization determines a need for convenience checks, your contractor bank will provide a supply of checks to the designated card/account holder drawn on the card/account holder's purchase card/account. The checks will be processed as they are presented for payment.

Convenience checks are multi-copied (one copy for the card/account holder's records and the original copy for the merchant). Due to the increased potential of fraud and abuse, specialized training on convenience checks is required prior to being authorized to write checks. If any misuse or abuse is discovered, the employee will lose convenience check and purchase card/account privileges. That employee will then be referred for disciplinary action in accordance with agency procedure.

Convenience checks may not be written for purchases above the maximum dollar limit established by your agency. In addition, convenience checks may not be written to:
- Vendors who accept the GSA SmartPay Purchase card/account.
- Vendor transactions already under another method of acquisition (purchase orders, contracts, etc.).
- Employee reimbursements.
- Cash advances.
- Salary payments, cash awards or any transaction processed through the payroll system.
- Travel-related transportation tickets.
- Meals or lodging related to employee travel except as related to emergency incident response.
- Other restrictions as determined by agency policy.

Checks must be used in sequential order. Each convenience check must be entered in a check register or log for tracking purposes. The following information must be written on each check:
- Date the check is being issued.
- The name of the payee.
- Amount of the check.
- An original signature.

When a convenience check is used to purchase services, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) requires the collection of that information, so that it can be reported as income to the IRS. If a person is “engaged in a trade or business and, in the course of that trade or business, pays any person $600 or more of rent, salaries, wages, premiums, annuities, compensations, remunerations, emoluments, or other fixed or determinable gains, profits and income during a calendar year, [IRS] Code Section 6041 generally requires them to file an information return with the IRS and to furnish an information statement to the payee.”

The IRS states that agencies may rely on the merchant category code (MCC) in determining whether a transaction is subject to Form 1099 reporting. Failure to file a correct information return [Form 1099](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-1099-misc) by the due date may result in a penalty imposed by the IRS.

## What are Government-to-Government transactions?
Government-to-government transactions are payments between different agencies (inter-governmental) or payments within the same agency (intra-governmental). In most instances, these transactions are classified under Merchant Category Code 9399, Miscellaneous Government Services. 

Effective October 1, 2022, the general limit on charge card payments within the same agency (intra-governmental) is set at $9,999.99. The general limit on charge card payments between different federal agencies (inter-governmental) remains $24,999.99. The government’s card acceptance policies can be found in [Treasury Financial Manual (TFM) Vol. I, Part 5, Chapter 7000](https://tfm.fiscal.treasury.gov/v1/p5/c700.html). It also addresses limitations on credit card transactions.

A few notes to keep in mind:

- Customers cannot divide an inter-governmental transaction into smaller pieces to evade this limit. For example, a buyer cannot make two purchases of $15,000 to avoid the $24,999.99 limit. 
- Customers cannot divide an intra-governmental transaction into smaller pieces to evade this limit. For example, a buyer cannot make two purchases of $6,000 to avoid the $9,999.99 limit. 
- Treasury retains the option to change limits. One goal is to reduce the fees the government pays when it accepts the purchase card/account for large transactions.
