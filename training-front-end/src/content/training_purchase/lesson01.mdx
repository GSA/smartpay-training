## What is the GSA SmartPay program?
Established in 1998, the GSA SmartPay program is the world’s largest government charge card and commercial payment solutions program, providing services to more than 560 federal agencies/organizations and Native American tribal governments with 6.5 million total accounts. GSA SmartPay payment solutions enable authorized government employees to make purchases on behalf of the federal government in support of their agency’s mission. The GSA SmartPay program includes the following business lines:
- GSA SmartPay Purchase.
- GSA SmartPay Travel.
- GSA SmartPay Fleet.
- GSA SmartPay Tax Advantage Travel.
- GSA SmartPay Integrated. 

Through the Master Contract with multiple banks, the GSA SmartPay program enables agencies/organizations across the federal government to obtain payment solutions to support mission needs. The Master Contract, administered by GSA, is a fixed price, indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract. The maximum base period for the initial order is four years with three, three-year options.

Agencies/organizations issue a task order under the GSA SmartPay 3 Master Contract to one of the GSA SmartPay contractor banks – Citibank or U.S. Bank. Then, the awarded bank provides payment solutions to the agency.

Through the task order, your agency/organization program coordinator (A/OPC) sets up accounts for the card/account holders, manages the accounts using the bank’s Electronic Access System (EAS), and resolves issues or questions by working directly with a bank representative.

To become a GSA SmartPay purchase card/account holder, your personal credit history is not criteria for receiving a purchase card/account. In addition, use of the purchase card/account will not affect your personal credit history. Any government employee authorized to use the GSA SmartPay program who has a responsibility to make purchases and completes the necessary training is eligible to become an card/account holder. Card/account holders are either appointed by their agency/organization program coordinator (A/OPC) or designated by an approving official (AO).

## What are the benefits to using the GSA SmartPay Master Contract for obtaining payment services?
The GSA SmartPay Program has continued to grow through increased adoption as agencies/organizations realize benefits afforded under the program. 

Utilizing the GSA SmartPay Master Contract means:
- A faster contract acquisition process and reduced risk of protest, as compared with a full and open competitive procurement.
- Favorable negotiating platform and contract terms.
- Awards to contractor banks based on a competitive bidding process.
- Established relationships with contractor banks.
- A broad range of flexible products and services for agencies/organizations as well as the flexibility to add products and services.
- Ongoing support for your agency/organization.

Other benefits include:
- **Cost Savings Realized:** Customers have the opportunity to realize administrative cost savings through payment efficiencies. In FY22 alone, the estimated administrative savings for the purchase card was $1.34 billion per year ($70 per transaction) when used in place of a written purchase order. In addition, agencies pay no direct fees to use GSA SmartPay solutions.
- **Agency Refunds:** Agencies have the opportunity to earn [refunds](https://youtu.be/5iYRruEPUNM) based on the dollar volume of transactions and the speed of payment.
- **Safety and Transparency:** The GSA SmartPay program provides secure solutions for efficient payment transactions. Customers also have access to tools that provide increased transparency to spend and performance data.
- **Electronic Access to Data:** Through the GSA SmartPay contractor bank’s electronic access system (EAS), account managers and card/account holders have immediate access to complete transaction-level data, helping to mitigate fraud, waste and abuse.
- **Worldwide Acceptance:** Through the use of commercial payment infrastructure, customers are able to use GSA SmartPay solutions anywhere in the world where merchants accept cards.
 
## What are some of the benefits for customers specific to the GSA SmartPay purchase card/account?

Use of the purchase card/account benefits the government in many ways, including:
- GSA SmartPay cards/accounts save the government time, money and resources.
- The GSA SmartPay purchase program provides the government with financial and cash management control over low dollar value high volume procurements and can serve as a payment tool for larger transactions consistent with agency policy.
- The government saves money by making only one payment to the contractor bank rather than thousands of payments to individual merchants.
- The government improves the use of its resources by freeing up contracting personnel so they are able to focus on more complex activities that derive greater benefit from their expertise.
- Merchants throughout the world accept the GSA SmartPay purchase card/account because they are familiar with commercial credit cards and they understand how to accept them.
- As a card/account holder, you will have the flexibility to decide what to purchase, when to buy it and from whom. You will also be able to monitor funds yourself.
- The GSA SmartPay purchase card/account also benefits merchants because they are paid quickly for the supplies and services they provide.

## What is a GSA SmartPay purchase card/account?
A purchase card/account is a type of payment solution issued by a GSA SmartPay contractor bank and used to pay for supplies or services procured at the direction of a federal agency/organization under official purchase authority. 

The GSA SmartPay purchase program is the preferred method of payment for federal employees to make official government purchases for supplies, goods and services under the micro-purchase threshold (MPT).

For micro-purchases, the GSA SmartPay purchase card/account may be used as a procurement, ordering and payment mechanism.

For purchases above the MPT, the GSA SmartPay purchase card/account may be used as an ordering and payment mechanism, but cannot be used as a procurement mechanism.

Card/account holders can purchase any commercially available supply or service within their spending limits and not prohibited by either federal or agency-specific procurement regulations.

## What is a Centrally Billed Account (CBA) and an Individually Billed Account (IBA) and why is it important to know the difference? 

### CBAs
- Agency is invoiced for purchases.
- Payments are made directly to the contractor banks by the federal government.
- Examples include purchase, fleet and some travel cards/accounts.  

### IBAs
- Card/account holder is invoiced directly.
- Payment is the responsibility of the card/account holder, who is then reimbursed by the agency/organization.
- Most common travel cards/accounts. 

The distinction between CBAs and IBAs is important when determining state tax exemption. All GSA SmartPay CBAs should be exempt from state taxes. In addition, with a CBA, the federal government accepts liability for charges made by an authorized card/account holder, but is not liable for any unauthorized use. Unauthorized use means the use of an account by a person, other than the card/account holder, who does not have actual, implied or apparent authority for such use and from which the card/account holder receives no benefit. When the CBA has been used by an authorized card/account holder to make an unauthorized purchase, the Government is liable for the charge and the agency is responsible for taking appropriate action against the card/account holder.

## What are convenience checks?
Some agencies allow for the use of convenience checks. 

Convenience checks are:
- A contractor-provided instrument that is written, dated and signed against an account within established dollar limits. 
- Intended only for the use with merchants that do not accept the GSA SmartPay purchase card/account. 
- A payment method of last resort, only when no reasonable alternative merchant is available who accepts the GSA SmartPay purchase card/account.

If your agency/organization determines a need for convenience checks, your contractor bank will provide a supply of checks to the designated card/account holder drawn on the card/account holder's purchase card/account. The checks will be processed as they are presented for payment.

Convenience checks are multi-copied (one copy for the card/account holder's records and the original copy for the merchant). Due to the increased potential of fraud and abuse, specialized training on convenience checks is required prior to being authorized to write checks. If any misuse or abuse is discovered, the employee will lose convenience check and purchase card/account privileges. That employee will then be referred for disciplinary action in accordance with agency procedure.

Convenience checks may not be written for purchases above the maximum dollar limit established by your agency. In addition, convenience checks may not be written to:
- Vendors who accept the GSA SmartPay purchase card/account.
- Vendor transactions already under another method of acquisition (purchase orders, contracts, etc.).
- Employee reimbursements.
- Cash advances.
- Salary payments, cash awards or any transaction processed through the payroll system.
- Travel-related transportation tickets.
- Meals or lodging related to employee travel except as related to emergency incident response.
- Other restrictions as determined by agency policy.

Checks must be used in sequential order. Each convenience check must be entered in a check register or log for tracking purposes. The following information must be written on each check:
- Date the check is being issued.
- The name of the payee.
- Amount of the check.
- An original signature.

When a convenience check is used to purchase services, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) requires the collection of that information, so that it can be reported as income to the IRS. If a person is “engaged in a trade or business and, in the course of that trade or business, pays any person $600 or more of rent, salaries, wages, premiums, annuities, compensations, remunerations, emoluments, or other fixed or determinable gains, profits and income during a calendar year, [IRS] Code Section 6041 generally requires them to file an information return with the IRS and to furnish an information statement to the payee.”

The IRS states that agencies may rely on the merchant category code (MCC) in determining whether a transaction is subject to [Form 1099](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-1099-misc) reporting. Failure to file a correct information return (Form 1099) by the due date may result in a penalty imposed by the IRS.
