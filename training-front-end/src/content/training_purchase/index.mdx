## Welcome to the GSA SmartPay Purchase Training for Account Holders and Approving Officials

This training course is intended to teach you the basics about your roles and responsibilities as an Account Holder/ AO and can be used as refresher training as required by your agency. We encourage you to also learn about your agencyâ€™s specific travel program requirements and policies.  After reviewing each lesson, click on the link to the next lesson below on the right side.
