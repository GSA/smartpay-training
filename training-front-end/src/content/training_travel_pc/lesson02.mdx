## What are some types of GSA SmartPay travel accounts?

### Individually Billed Accounts (IBAs)
- Most common travel account.
- Issued to an employee designated by the agency/organization in the employee’s name.
- Used to pay for official travel and travel-related expenses. 
- Only issued to federal employees or employees of tribes or tribal organizations.
- May be used for local travel only if authorized by written policy of the agency/organization. 
- Agencies/organizations reimburse employees only for authorized and allowable expenses. 
- Card/account holders are directly responsible for all purchases charged to the IBA account. 
- Payment may be made directly by the card/account holder, agency/organization or in the form of a split disbursement in accordance with agency/organization policy.

### Centrally Billed Accounts (CBAs)
- Established by the bank at the request of the agency/organization to pay for official travel charges and official travel-related expenses.
- Generally used to purchase common carrier transportation tickets for employee official travel through third-party arrangements, such as the GSA E-Gov Travel Service (ETS) for civilian agencies, the Defense Travel System (DTS) for the Department of Defense or permissible equivalent travel system. 
- Agencies/organizations may also make purchases through their Travel Management Centers (TMCs), commercial travel offices and through other government contracts.
- Agency is directly billed and is liable for making the payment.
- Payment is made directly to the bank by the government.  

### Tax Advantage Travel Accounts
- Issued to an employee designated by the agency/organization in the employee’s name.
- Used to pay for travel and travel-related expenses.
- Combines IBA and CBA transactions to provide tax exemption at the point of sale for rental car and lodging expenses.
- Charges for rental cars and lodging will be automatically billed to a CBA for payment, taking advantage of the government’s CBA tax exemption status for those types of accounts. 
- Charges for other travel-related purchases, such as meals and incidentals, are billed to the IBA portion of the account and will still incur tax. The individual traveler will still be liable for payment to the bank for those charges.

## How do I recognize GSA SmartPay travel cards/accounts?
Typically, travel cards have one of the following two designs:

<Image class='margin-y-2' src='gsa_card_tax.png' alt="GSA SmartPay card design" width="160" />

GSA SmartPay travel accounts use the following prefixes:

- Visa: 4486, 4614, 4716 
- Mastercard: 5565, 5568

For the travel business line only, the sixth-digit will identify whether the account is a CBA or IBA.

| Account Type | Sixth Digit | Billing Type |
| ------------ | ----------- | ------------ |
| <Image class='margin-y-1' src='gsa_card_travel.png' alt="GSA SmartPay card design" width="110" /> | 1, 2, 3, 4 | IBA |
| <Image class='margin-y-1' src='gsa_card_travel.png' alt="GSA SmartPay card design" width="110" /> | 6, 7, 8, 9, 0 | CBA |
| <Image class='margin-y-1' src='gsa_card_tax.png' alt="GSA SmartPay card design" width="110" /> | 5 | CBA/IBA | 

## Why is it important to understand your travel account type?
Tax exemption and liability differ depending on the travel account type.

### Tax exemption considerations
- All GSA SmartPay CBAs should be exempt from state taxes. 
- Federal government travelers using the GSA SmartPay IBAs may be exempt from state taxes in select states. 
- Card/account holders should review and understand the state tax policy for the state where you will be traveling to and should make sure to have all necessary forms before traveling.

### Liability considerations

#### IBA Accounts 
- Liability for all charges rests with the individual card/account holder. 
- If the card/account holder fails to pay his/her account on a timely basis, the bank may suspend or cancel the account and assess late charges and fees. 
- If the bank cancels an account due to delinquency, the bank may report that information to credit bureaus and the information will appear on the card/account holder’s personal credit report. 
- The bank can pursue debt collection to obtain repayment of the charges.
- The agency/organization is never responsible or legally liable for the account.

#### CBA Accounts
- The federal government accepts liability only for those proper charges made by an authorized card/account holder, but is not liable for any unauthorized use. 
- Unauthorized use means the use of an account by a person, other than the card/account holder, who does not have actual, implied or apparent authority for such use and from which the card/account holder receives no benefit. 
- When the account has been used by an authorized card/account holder to make an unauthorized purchase, the government is liable for the charge and the agency is responsible for taking appropriate action against the card/account holder.

#### Tax Advantage Travel Accounts
- Because the account is a combination of both CBA and IBA, the liability will be determined by the type of purchase. 
- If the purchase is a CBA, the liability falls on the government.
- If the purchase is an IBA, the liability falls on the card/account holder. 

## How does the GSA SmartPay Tax Advantage Travel account work?
The Tax Advantage Travel account is issued to an employee designated by the agency/organization in the employee’s name. 

Agency/organization program coordinators (A/OPCs) will work with their contractor bank to identify Merchant Category Codes (MCCs) for rental cars and lodging to be excluded from taxes. 

Accounts will be established using IBA procedures, to include credit checks or other creditworthiness assessments. 

When the card/account is used, invoices will be sent to the employee and the agency/organization for payment via split disbursement. 

The CBA portion of the charges will be paid by the agency and the IBA portion of the charges will be the responsibility of the employee.

Agencies/organizations must specify invoice elements in their task order level requirements.

### Here’s an example of Tax Advantage Travel account use: 
Andrew is on official government travel and is checking into the hotel using his Tax Advantage Travel account. The process does not change from how hotel vendors run the card and verify tax exemption status today. The hotel will need to verify (through use of the 6th digit and the BIN) that the payment is being directly provided by the government through the CBA function. Once verified, Andrew will provide any required CBA forms to the hotel. Required forms vary from state to state and can be found on the [GSA SmartPay website](https://smartpay.gsa.gov/smarttax). Even if the state does not exempt taxes for the IBA transactions today, it is still required to exempt all of the CBA transactions. At the end of the month, when Andrew receives his invoice from the bank, the hotel should already be paid for through his agency’s CBA process. He will just need to pay for his meals and incidentals.

## What is the appropriate use of the GSA SmartPay travel account?
The GSA SmartPay travel accounts may be used ONLY for authorized official travel and travel-related expenses. Official travel expenses are broadly categorized as transportation, lodging, meals and incidentals.

The travel account must not be used for personal expenses unrelated to official government travel. This is considered to be misuse of the account or use of a federal payment solution by an authorized user for other than the official government purpose(s) for which it is intended.

To help prevent misuse, the travel account may be electronically coded to be rejected at merchant locations that your agency has determined are not necessary for conducting official government business.

Some agencies allow the GSA SmartPay travel account to be used for local travel. 

### Here’s an example of local travel use: 
Sarah is traveling to a training class in Washington, D.C., which is located within the vicinity of her regular duty station. To attend the event, she must either take a taxi or public transportation. Official government travel authorization is not provided or necessary for this class. However, Sarah is able to use her GSA SmartPay travel account because her agency policy has authorized employees to use their IBA travel card for local travel and related expenses.
