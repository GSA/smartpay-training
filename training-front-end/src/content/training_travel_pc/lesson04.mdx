order: 4
---

## What are some A/OPC responsibilities?

### General
- Oversees the travel program for your agency/organization to best support your mission.
- Serves as the liaison between the card/account holder, the contractor bank, your management and the GSA Center for Charge Card Management (CCCM).
- Please note that the lead A/OPC may be supported by regional or field A/OPCs with distinct responsibilities.

### Managing Card/Account Holders
- Maintains a current list of account names, account numbers, contact information of all current card/account holders and accounts.
- Maintains a current list of agency/organization points of contact for Designated Billing Offices (DBOs), Transaction Dispute Offices (TDOs) and Electronic Commerce/Electronic Data Interchange Offices (EOs), as applicable.
- Ensures card/account holders use the travel program correctly.
- Monitors account activity and manages delinquencies.
- Ensures that appropriate steps are taken to mitigate suspension or cancellation actions.

### Training
- Receives training before appointment and participates in refresher training a minimum of every three years (or less depending on agency/organization policies) in accordance with [OMB Circular A-123, Appendix B](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Issuance-of-Revised-Appendix-B-to-OMB-Circular-A-123.pdf).
- Participates in annual training forums and disseminates information and lessons learned to other A/OPCs, account managers and card/account holders.
- Ensures that card/account holders are trained prior to receiving their travel account and that they take refresher training at a minimum every three years (or more often if required by your agency).

### Master Contract/Task Order Compliance
- Oversees the business line for your agency/organization and establishes agency/organization guidelines.
- Directs the contractor to establish accounts.
- Serves as liaison between the card/account holder and the contractor.
- Provides on-going program guidance.
- Audits accounts as required.
- Keeps necessary account information current for the agency/organization.
- Please note that the terms and conditions of the GSA SmartPay Master Contract can only be modified by the GSA SmartPay Contracting Officer. The A/OPC does not provide supervisory guidance to the contractor’s personnel.

### Card/Account Holder Hierarchies
- Establishes card/account holder hierarchies, which are often associated with billing and organizational structures. 
- Please note that hierarchy structures may vary from agency to agency due to each agency’s unique requirements. This includes the number of card/account holders managed by each A/OPC and the level of problem resolution. Once your agency determines the structure and requirements needed, the contractor will be able to assist with establishing your agency hierarchy levels.

### Communication
- Keeps the lines of communication open with all key program participants, including senior management/leadership.
- Stays in touch with travel program participants by networking, asking questions and sharing policy changes, program information and/or other travel account information.
- Please note that A/OPCs should try to establish relationships with the card/account holders within your span of control. The better you understand each travel card/account holder's travel history and needs, the more effective you can be in managing the program and preventing or detecting misuse and fraud.

## How does the bank support the A/OPC?
The contractor bank can provide you with tools to assist in successful management of your agency’s travel program, including:
- Establishing and maintaining accounts.
- Providing an electronic access system (EAS).
- Providing data mining tools and assistance to help detect potential fraud/misuse.
- Providing forms and reports.
- Resolving disputes.

## How do I set up travel accounts?
As the A/OPC, you are responsible for the setting up and maintenance of centrally billed accounts (CBAs) and individually billed accounts (IBAs). Refer to your contractor’s A/OPC Guide and EAS Manual for instructions on how to set up accounts.

In cases where there is an emergency, the A/OPC can request that the contractor process and send emergency and/or expedited account cards within 24 hours, including international requests. These requests include, but are not limited to, responses to natural disasters (like hurricanes and earthquakes), threats to national security and military mobilization. The emergency accounts will arrive via overnight delivery at the contractor’s expense.

## How are accounts closed/terminated and what are the recommended exit procedures?
There are four steps to closing or terminating an account:
- Immediately notify the bank when a card/account holder leaves the agency/organization, is terminated from employment or no longer requires a travel account.
- Follow the account close out procedures from your contractor bank.
- Instruct the card/account holder to destroy/dispose of the card by cutting it into pieces.
- Review the master file/account holder listing to ensure the account is closed.


## Are A/OPCs able to suspend or cancel an account? 
Yes, A/OPCs are able to suspend or cancel an account.

Suspension is the process by which an account is deactivated due to delinquency or multiple pre-suspension actions. An account is considered past due if payment for undisputed principal amounts has not been received within 45 calendar days from the billing date. 

An account can be canceled if an undisputed balance remains unpaid for the prescribed number of calendar days from the billing date. An account may also be canceled for numerous suspensions.


A reason must be documented for suspension or cancellation. Accounts may be canceled through your bank’s electronic access system (EAS) or through the bank’s customer service office. Under certain conditions, an A/OPC may request the contractor bank to delay or accelerate action for suspending or canceling an account.

In summary, please refer to the chart below:

| Number Calendar Days | Account Status/Action |
| -------------------- | --------------------- |
| 46 days from the billing date | Pre-Suspension |
| 61 days from the billing date | Suspension/Pre-Cancellation |
| 126 days from the billing date | Cancellation |
| 180 days from the billing date | Charge-Off/Write-Off |

**Please refer to your agency policy for specific delinquency stages as they may differ.*

For more details on suspension/cancellation procedures, see the GSA SmartPay Master Contract, Section C.3.3.11 Suspension Procedures and Section C.3.3.12 Cancellation Procedures.

The bank is required to automatically reinstate suspended accounts upon payment of the undisputed principal amount unless otherwise specified by you. You may also notify the bank of any mission-related, extenuating circumstances for which the account should not be suspended within the notification timeframes mentioned previously. Once an account has been canceled, the contractor bank is under no obligation to reinstate the account.

Please note that the government accepts no liability for charges made against the individually billed account.

## What happens if a travel card/account is lost or stolen?
It is the card/account holder’s responsibility to immediately report the lost or stolen travel card/account to:
- The contractor bank.
- You, the A/OPC.
- Their supervisor.

Once a card/account has been reported as lost or stolen, the contractor bank immediately blocks that account from further usage and a new account number will be issued to the card/account holder.
Reporting the card/account as stolen does not relieve the card/account holder or the government of payment for any transactions that were made by the card/account holder prior to reporting it stolen. If you do not recognize a transaction appearing on your statement, you are responsible for notifying the contractor bank within 90 calendar days from the transaction date to initiate a dispute, unless otherwise specified by the agency/organization. This notification of transaction dispute may occur via the EAS, by telephone or other electronic means like email.
Please note that you relinquish your right to recover a disputed amount after 90 calendar days from the date that the transaction was processed. It is your responsibility to dispute questionable charges. If you don’t, you will be held personally liable for the amount of the questionable charge.
