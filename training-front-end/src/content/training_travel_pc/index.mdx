## Welcome to the GSA SmartPay® Travel Training for Agency/Organization Program Coordinators (A/OPCs)

As an A/OPC, you play a critical role in your agency’s/organization’s travel program. You work with the card/account holders, the bank and other key stakeholders to ensure that all travel accounts are effectively managed.
This training course is intended to teach you the basics about your roles and responsibilities as an A/OPC. The course can be used as refresher training as required by your agency. In addition, we encourage you to also learn about your agency’s specific travel program policies since they will be the foundation of your day-to-day duties. After reviewing each lesson, click on the button to go to the next lesson. The quiz is only available on the website and can be accessed after you complete the final lesson. 

**Note:** The GSA SmartPay training website is an independent training system and does not connect/communicate with any other agency training systems.
