## Welcome to the GSA SmartPay® Travel Training for Card/Account Holders and Approving Officials

As a federal government employee going on official government travel, you are expected to be familiar with the [Federal Travel Regulations (FTR)](http://www.gsa.gov/ftr) and other government travel policies.

This training course is intended to teach you the basics about your roles and responsibilities as a card/account holder or approving official and can be used as refresher training as required by your agency. We encourage you to also learn about your agency’s specific travel program requirements and policies. After reviewing each lesson, click on the button to go to the next lesson. The quiz is only available on the website and can be accessed after you complete the final lesson. You can also view and print the full [Travel Training for Card/Account Holders and Approving Officials (508 compliant)](./printable). If you have already reviewed the material, you can skip ahead to the quiz. 

Note: The GSA SmartPay training website is an independent training system and does not connect/communicate with any other agency training systems.
