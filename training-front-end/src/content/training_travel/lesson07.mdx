## Can I receive a cash advance?
In accordance with agency policy, you may obtain cash to cover all anticipated out-of-pocket cash expenses for the trip before you leave. The preferred and most efficient method to obtain a cash advance is by using your government travel account to withdraw cash from an ATM machine. As a reminder, do not withdraw cash for personal use.

## How do I get my airline tickets?
Most Travel Management Centers (TMC) or Commercial Travel Offices (CTO) use e-ticketing and will send your itinerary and ticket confirmation through email. With e-ticketing, you will not get a physical ticket, only information about the reservation. If your TMC/CTO mails airline tickets, pick up your ticket as close to the date of departure as possible.

Federal employees may retain, for personal use, frequent flyer miles earned while on official government travel.
