## What are some types of GSA SmartPay travel card/accounts?

### Individually Billed Accounts (IBAs)
- Most common travel card/account.
- Issued to an employee designated by the agency/organization in the employee’s name.
- Used to pay for official travel and travel-related expenses. 
- Only issued to federal employees or employees of tribes or tribal organizations.
- May be used for local travel only if authorized by written policy of the agency/organization. 
- Agencies/organizations reimburse employees only for authorized and allowable expenses. 
- Card/account holders are directly responsible for all purchases charged to the IBA card/account. 
- Payment may be made directly by the card/account holder, agency/organization or in the form of a split disbursement in accordance with agency/organization policy.

### Centrally Billed Accounts (CBAs)
- Established by the bank at the request of the agency/organization to pay for official travel charges and official travel-related expenses.
- Generally used to purchase common carrier transportation tickets for employee official travel through third-party arrangements, such as the GSA E-Gov Travel Service (ETS) for civilian agencies, the Defense Travel System (DTS) for the Department of Defense or permissible equivalent travel system. 
- Agencies/organizations may also make purchases through their Travel Management Centers (TMCs), commercial travel offices and through other government contracts.
- Agency is directly billed and is liable for making the payment.
- Payment is made directly to the bank by the government.  

### Tax Advantage Travel Accounts
- Issued to an employee designated by the agency/organization in the employee’s name.
- Used to pay for travel and travel-related expenses.
- Combines IBA and CBA transactions to provide tax exemption at the point of sale for rental car and lodging expenses.
- Charges for rental cars and lodging will be automatically billed to a CBA for payment, taking advantage of the government’s CBA tax exemption status for those types of card/accounts. 
- Charges for other travel-related purchases, such as meals and incidentals, are billed to the IBA portion of the card/account and will still incur tax. The individual traveler will still be liable for payment to the bank for those charges.


## How do I recognize GSA SmartPay travel card/accounts?
Typically, travel cards have one of the following two designs:

<Image class='margin-y-2' src='gsa_card_tax.png' alt="GSA SmartPay card design" width="160" />

GSA SmartPay travel card/accounts use the following prefixes:

- Visa: 4486, 4614, 4716 
- Mastercard: 5565, 5568

For the travel business line only, the sixth-digit will identify whether the card/account is a CBA or IBA.

| Account Type | Sixth Digit | Billing Type |
| ------------ | ----------- | ------------ |
| <Image class='margin-y-1' src='gsa_card_travel.png' alt="GSA SmartPay card design" width="110" /> | 1, 2, 3, 4 | IBA |
| <Image class='margin-y-1' src='gsa_card_travel.png' alt="GSA SmartPay card design" width="110" /> | 6, 7, 8, 9, 0 | CBA |
| <Image class='margin-y-1' src='gsa_card_tax.png' alt="GSA SmartPay card design" width="110" /> | 5 | CBA/IBA | 

## Why is it important to understand your travel card/account type?
Tax exemption and liability differ depending on the travel card/account type.

### Tax exemption considerations: 
- All GSA SmartPay CBAs should be exempt from state taxes. 
- Federal government travelers using the GSA SmartPay IBAs may be exempt from state taxes in select states. 
- Card/account holders should review and understand the state tax policy for the state where you will be traveling to and should make sure to have all necessary forms before traveling.

### Liability considerations:
#### IBA Accounts
- Liability for all charges rests with the individual card/account holder. 
- If the account holder fails to pay his/her account on a timely basis, the bank may suspend or cancel the account and assess late charges and fees. 
- If the bank cancels an account due to delinquency, the bank may report that information to credit bureaus and the information will appear on the card/account holder’s personal credit report. 
- The bank can pursue debt collection to obtain repayment of the charges.
- The agency/organization is never responsible or legally liable for the card/account.

#### CBA Accounts
- The federal government accepts liability only for those proper charges made by an authorized card/account holder, but is not liable for any unauthorized use. 
- Unauthorized use means the use of a card/account by a person, other than the account holder, who does not have actual, implied or apparent authority for such use and from which the card/account holder receives no benefit. 
- When the card/account has been used by an authorized card/account holder to make an unauthorized purchase, the government is liable for the charge and the agency is responsible for taking appropriate action against the card/account holder.

#### Tax Advantage Travel Accounts
- Because the card/account is a combination of both CBA and IBA, the liability will be determined by the type of purchase. 
- If the purchase is a CBA, the liability falls on the government.
- If the purchase is an IBA, the liability falls on the card/account holder.

## How would someone check tax exemption status? 
Here is a typical example of how to check tax exemption status:  
- Jo is planning an official government trip to the GSA SmartPay Training Forum in Orlando, Florida. 
- During the planning stages for the trip, she checks the GSA SmartPay website to find out more information about tax exemption in Florida. 
- Jo learns that IBA travel card/accounts are tax exempt in Florida. In addition, while no form is required, Florida does allow hotels to require a “Certificate of Exemption”. She also saved the Florida Department of Revenue’s phone number in case any questions came up during her trip. 
- Jo confirms that she has a GSA SmartPay IBA travel card/account – the first four digits are “4486” and the 6th digit is a “4”. 
- Jo books the hotel room and follows up with a call to verify that the hotel is compliant with the state’s tax exemption policy. If not, she’s given herself plenty of time to find another hotel that does comply.
