## I’m an account holder with questions related to my specific account. How do I reach out to my agency’s contractor bank directly?

### Citibank
- 800-790-7206 (within United States)
- 904-954-7850 (collect calls from outside United States)
- [Citibank Online Account Access](https://home.cards.citidirect.com/CommercialCard/Cards.html) (self register, commercial site).

### U.S. Bank
- 888-994-6722 (within United States)  
Note: To speak with a live person, do not press any buttons.
- 701-461-2232 (collect calls from outside United States)
- [U.S. Bank Online Account Access](https://access.usbank.com/cpsApp1/index.jsp) (self register, commercial site).

Customer service numbers are also available on the:
- [GSA SmartPay® website](http://smartpay.gsa.gov).
- Back of your travel charge card.

You can contact the bank with issues related to payment, delinquency, address/personal information change, confusion about your bill, disputed items, how to use the bank’s online account access website and other questions related to specific account information. 

Customer service representatives are accessible to both domestic and international account holders through a dedicated email address and toll-free numbers, 24 hours a day, every day of the year. If you need help contacting the banks or dealing with specific issues, your agency/organization program coordinator (A/OPC) can assist you.

The GSA SmartPay banks offer a secure, web-based electronic access system (EAS), which allows you to view your account electronically at any time. In addition, many agencies allow for mobile application capabilities including the ability to access EAS, pay invoices, receive text/email alerts and view statement and payment information over a mobile device. You should request electronic access, along with login and password information, when you apply for a travel account.

## How do I report a lost/stolen account?
Report a lost or stolen travel account promptly to:
- The contractor bank.
- Your A/OPC.
- Your supervisor.

Once an account has been reported as lost or stolen, the contractor bank immediately blocks that account from further usage and a new account number will be issued to the account holder.

Reporting the account as stolen does not relieve the account holder or the government of payment for any transactions that were made by the account holder prior to reporting it stolen. If you do not recognize a transaction appearing on your statement, you are responsible for notifying the contractor bank within 90 calendar days from the transaction date to initiate a dispute, unless otherwise specified by the agency/organization. This notification of transaction dispute may occur via the EAS, by telephone or other electronic means like email.

Please note that you relinquish your right to recover a disputed amount after 90 calendar days from the date that the transaction was processed. It is your responsibility to dispute questionable charges. If you don’t, you will be held personally liable for the amount of the questionable charge.

## What happens if my address changes?
If you change your address, please be sure to contact the bank immediately with your new information by one of the following means:
- Calling the toll-free contractor bank number listed on the back of your account.
- Using the bank's EAS.
- Asking your A/OPC to submit the change electronically.

Please also make sure to notify your local post office of your address change so that your mail will be forwarded.
